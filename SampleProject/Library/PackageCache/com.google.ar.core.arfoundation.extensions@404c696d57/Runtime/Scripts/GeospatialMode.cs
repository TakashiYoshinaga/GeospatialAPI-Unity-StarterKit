    /// The Geospatial API is able to provide the best user experience when it is able to generate
    /// high accuracy poses. However, the Geospatial API can be used anywhere, as long as the device

    /// than 5 meters and often around 1 meter, and a rotational accuracy of better than 5 degrees.
