# AR tracked image manager

The tracked image manager is a type of [trackable manager](trackable-managers.md) and performs 2D image tracking.

![AR tracked image manager](images/ar-tracked-image-manager.png "AR tracked image manager")

The tracked image manager creates [GameObjects](xref:GameObjects) for each detected image in the environment. Before an image can be detected, the manager must be instructed to look for a set of reference images compiled into a reference image library. It only detects images in this library.

## Reference library

For instructions on how to create a reference image library in the Unity Editor, see documentation on the [Tracked Image Subsystem](xref:arsubsystems-image-tracking-subsystem).

The reference image library can be set at runtime, but as long as the tracked image manager component is enabled, the reference image library must be non-null. You can set it via script with:

```csharp
ARTrackedImageManager manager = ...;
manager.referenceLibrary = myReferenceImageLibrary;
```

You can set the reference image library to be either an [XRReferenceImageLibrary](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRReferenceImageLibrary) or a [RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary). You can only create an `XRReferenceImageLibrary` in the Editor, and you can't modify it at runtime. A `RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary` is the runtime representation of an `XRReferenceImageLibrary`. When you set the library to be an `XRReferenceImageLibrary`, the image tracking subsystem automatically converts it to a `RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary` for consumption.

The actual image library data is provider-specific; refer to your provider's documentation for details.

You can create a `RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary` from an `XRReferenceImageLibrary` with the [`ARTrackedImageManager.CreateRuntimeLibrary`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARTrackedImageManager.CreateRuntimeLibrary(UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRReferenceImageLibrary)) method:

```csharp
XRReferenceImageLibrary serializedLibrary = ...
RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary runtimeLibrary = trackedImageManager.CreateRuntimeLibrary(serializedLibrary);
```

⚠️ **Note** The ordering of the [XRReferenceImage](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRReferenceImage)s in the `RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary` is undefined; that is, it may not match the order in which the images appeared in the source `XRReferenceImageLibrary`. Each reference image does have a string name that you assign it, and a randomly assigned [Guid](xref:System.Guid). The `Guid` are the same between the source `XRReferenceImageLibrary` and its corresponding `RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary`.

## Responding to detected images

Subscribe to the ARTrackedImageManager's [trackedImagesChanged](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARTrackedImageManager.trackedImagesChanged) event to be notified whenever an image is added (i.e., first detected), updated, or removed:

[!code-cs[trackedimage_subscribe_to_events](../Tests/CodeSamples/TrackedImageSamples.cs#trackedimage_subscribe_to_events)]

Note that images also have a [tracking state](#tracking-state) which can provide additional information about the tracking quality. An image that goes out of view, for example, may not be "removed", but its tracking state will likely change.

You can also get all the currently tracked images with the ARTrackedImageManager's [trackables](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARTrackableManager`4.trackables) property. This acts like an [IEnumerable](xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable) collection, so you can use it in a `foreach` statement:

[!code-cs[trackedimage_enumerate_trackables](../Tests/CodeSamples/TrackedImageSamples.cs#trackedimage_enumerate_trackables)]

Or access a specific image by its [TrackableId](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.TrackableId):

[!code-cs[trackedimage_get_by_trackableId](../Tests/CodeSamples/TrackedImageSamples.cs#trackedimage_get_by_trackableId)]

## Tracked Image Prefab

The [ARTrackedImageManager](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARTrackedImageManager) has a ["Tracked Image Prefab"](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARTrackedImageManager.trackedImagePrefab) field; however, this is not intended for content. When an image is detected, ARFoundation will create a new [GameObject](xref:GameObjects) to represent it.

If "Tracked Image Prefab" is `null`, then ARFoundation simply creates a GameObject with an [ARTrackedImage](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARTrackedImage) component on it. However, if you want _every tracked image_ to also include additional components, you can provide a prefab for ARFoundation to instantiate for each detected image. In other words, the purpose of the prefab field is to _extend_ the default behavior of tracked images; it is not the recommended way to _place content_ in the world.

If you would like to [instantiate](xref:UnityEngine.Object.Instantiate(UnityEngine.Object)) content at the pose of the detected image and have its pose updated automatically, then you should parent your content to the `ARTrackedImage`.

## Adding new reference images at runtime

Some subsystems might support image libraries that are modifiable at runtime. In this case, the subsystem produces a `RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary` that is a `MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary`. To use it, you need to cast the `RuntimeReferenceImageLibrary` to a `MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary`:

[!code-cs[trackedimage_ScheduleAddImageJob](../Tests/CodeSamples/TrackedImageSamples.cs#trackedimage_ScheduleAddImageJob)]

To create an empty library that you can add images to later, you can call `CreateRuntimeLibrary` without arguments:

[!code-cs[trackedimage_CreateRuntimeLibrary](../Tests/CodeSamples/TrackedImageSamples.cs#trackedimage_CreateRuntimeLibrary)]

You can check whether a particular tracked image manager supports mutable libraries with its descriptor:

[!code-cs[trackedimage_supportsMutableLibrary](../Tests/CodeSamples/TrackedImageSamples.cs#trackedimage_supportsMutableLibrary)]

You can add images to mutable libraries allow images at any time. Adding an image can be computationally expensive, and might take a few frames to complete. The [Unity Job System](xref:JobSystem) is used to process images asynchronously.

To add an image to a [MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary), use the [ScheduleAddImageJob](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibraryExtensions.ScheduleAddImageJob(UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary,UnityEngine.Texture2D,System.String,System.Nullable{System.Single},Unity.Jobs.JobHandle)) method. This returns a [JobHandle](xref:Unity.Jobs.JobHandle) that you can use to determine when the job is complete. You can safely discard this handle if you don't need to do this.

If you use the [extension method](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibraryExtensions.ScheduleAddImageJob(UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary,UnityEngine.Texture2D,System.String,System.Nullable{System.Single},Unity.Jobs.JobHandle)) which accepts a [Texture2D](xref:UnityEngine.Texture2D), you do not need to manage any memory.

If you use the version of [ScheduleAddImageJob](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary.ScheduleAddImageJob(Unity.Collections.NativeSlice{System.Byte},UnityEngine.Vector2Int,UnityEngine.TextureFormat,UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRReferenceImage,Unity.Jobs.JobHandle)) that accepts a [NativeSlice](xref:Unity.Collections.NativeSlice`1) or pointer, you are responsible for managing the memory, i.e., freeing it when the job completes. You can do this by scheduling a dependent job that frees the memory:

[!code-cs[trackedimage_DeallocateOnJobCompletion](../Tests/CodeSamples/TrackedImageSamples.cs#trackedimage_DeallocateOnJobCompletion)]

Multiple add image jobs can be processed concurrently. Whether or not `MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary` is currently in use for image tracking has no effect on this.

## Creating a manager at runtime

When you add a component to an active `GameObject` at runtime, Unity immediately invokes its `OnEnable` method. However, the `ARTrackedImageManager` requires a non-null reference image library. If the reference image library is null when the `ARTrackedImageManager` is enabled, it will automatically disable itself.

To add an `ARTrackedImageManager` at runtime, set its reference image library and then re-enable it:

```csharp
var manager = gameObject.AddComponent<ARTrackedImageManager>();
manager.referenceLibrary = myLibrary;
manager.enabled = true;
```

## Maximum number of moving images

Some providers can track moving images. This typically requires more CPU resources, so you can specify the number of moving images to track simultaneously. Check for support via the `SubsystemDescriptor` (`ARTrackedImageManager.descriptor`).

## Tracked image prefab

This prefab is instantiated whenever an image from the reference image library is detected. The manager ensures the instantiated `GameObject` includes an `ARTrackedImage` component. You can get the reference image that was used to detect the `ARTrackedImage` with the `ARTrackedImage.referenceImage` property.

## Tracking State
There are three possible tracking states for `ARTrackedImages`:

| TrackingState                                                     | Description                   |
|:---------------:                                                  |:-------------                 |
| [None](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.TrackingState.None)       | The image is not being tracked. Note that this may be the initial state when the image is first detected. |
| [Limited](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.TrackingState.Limited) | The image is being tracked, but not as well. The situations in which an image is considered `Limited` instead of `Tracking` depend on the underlying AR framework. Examples that may cause `Limited` tracking include:  <ul><li>Obscuring the image so that it is not visible to the camera.</li><li>The image is not tracked as a moving image. This can happen, for example, if the `maxNumberOfMovingImages` is exceeded.</li></ul>
| [Tracking](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.TrackingState.Tracking) | The underlying AR SDK reports that it is actively tracking the image. |

### Determining when an image is visible

There is no API to determine the visibility of an image. Generally, if the tracking state is [Tracking](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.TrackingState.Tracking), it will likely change to `Limited` when the image is not visible. However, there are other situations in which the tracking state can be in states other than `Tracked`.

If this information is important to your application, considering comparing the `ARTrackedImage`'s transform with the camera's view frustum.
