# XR mesh subsystem

Provider packages for platforms that support 3D reconstruction of physical surroundings may implement the [XRMeshSubsystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/XR.XRMeshSubsystem.html). The purpose of this subsystem is the efficient generation of meshes inside of Unity based on the geometry data provided by an XR device.

In addition to creating meshes, the subsystem can be used to get information about generated meshes and to limit the volumes in which meshes are created.
